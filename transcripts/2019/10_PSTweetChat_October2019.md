> [@WesCarrollTech I can recommend @cirzen's BigAsciiChars. It has some issues on there aiming at getting the module ready for release on the PS Gallery. One of them is as simple as adding a screenshot or two of example usage to the README ;) #PSTweetChat](https://twitter.com/WindosNZ/status/1180178486457065472)

> [Including the hashtag so this gets captured. #PSTweetChat RT @TrententTye: @JeffHicks Do that in a hybrid cloud environment and doing some actions will be painfully slow. Azure datacenters aren?t all local. Time is money except in the cloud I guess? Why is this workflow unacceptable? There are many good reasons why this should be possible. Terminal is awesome.](https://twitter.com/JeffHicks/status/1180178743140257792)

> [@JanEgilRing Not at all! Having a scenario like the one you proposed really helps me grok the offering and then how it can be used elsewhere. Sometimes I need that specific spark to make things click into place. #PSTweetChat](https://twitter.com/WindosNZ/status/1180179108191358976)

> [@JeffHicks @IDS2012 If you're used to it via modules like PoshRSJob, it's nice to no longer *have* to install a module. But yes, the overhead on spinning up and tearing down runspaces can outweigh the parallelization gains. #PSTweetChat](https://twitter.com/WindosNZ/status/1180180278901239808)

### [@WindosNZ](https://twitter.com/WindosNZ) \<Josh (Windos) King\>

> [@JeffHicks @IDS2012 Also, be careful if your job is super trivial (like doing literally nothing) as it'll iterate so fast that garbage collection (not the right term, but it's early) can't keep up and it'll consume *LOTS* of memory until is catches back up. #PSTweetChat](https://twitter.com/WindosNZ/status/1180180657986650112)

> [@WindosNZ @FredWeinmann There was an attempt this year, also with @FredWeinmann as a speaker. But it didn't got any further. So I would try it for my one. May with some O365 related stuff.

> [@BrettMiller_IT Made a credential handler for O365 stuff. So I select credentials from an OGV pass them to a session variable and connect to a 365 service. Quite handy. #pstweetchat](https://twitter.com/IDS2012/status/1180190703172890625)
